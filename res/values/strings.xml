    <string name="ada"><b>Ada Lovelace</b><i>(1815-1852)</i> was born Augusta Ada Byron, 
        the only legitimate child of Annabella Milbanke 
        and the poet Lord Byron. Her mother, Lady Byron, 
        had mathematical training (Byron called her his \'Princess of Parallelograms\') 
        and insisted that Ada, who was tutored privately, 
        study mathematics too - an unusual education for a woman.\n\nAda met Babbage at a party in 1833 
when she was seventeen and was entranced 
when Babbage demonstrated the small working section 
of the Engine to her. 
She intermitted her mathematical studies 
for marriage and motherhood but resumed 
when domestic duties allowed. 
In 1843 she published a translation from the French 
of an article on the Analytical Engine by an Italian engineer, 
Luigi Menabrea, to which Ada added extensive notes of her own. 
The Notes included the first published description of 
a stepwise sequence of operations for solving certain 
mathematical problems and Ada is often referred to 
as \'the first programmer\'.
The collaboration with Babbage was close 
and biographers debate the extent and originality 
of Ada\'s contribution.\n\nPerhaps more importantly,
the article contained statements by Ada 
that from a modern perspective are visionary. 
She speculated that the Engine \'might act upon other things 
besides number &#8230; the Engine might compose elaborate 
and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity 
or extent\'. 
The idea of a machine that could manipulate symbols 
in accordance with rules and that number could represent 
entities other than quantity mark 
the fundamental transition from calculation to computation. 
Ada was the first to explicitly articulate this notion 
and in this she appears to have seen further than Babbage. 
She has been referred to as \'prophet of the computer age\'. 
Certainly she was the first to express the potential 
for computers outside mathematics. 
In this the tribute is well-founded.\n\n<i>Source: Computer History Museum</i></string>

    <string name="babbage"><b>Vital Statistics</b>\nCharles Babbage (1791-1871) was born in Walworth, 
        Surrey, on December 26, 1791. 
        He was one of four children born to 
        the banker Benjamin Babbage and Elizabeth Teape. 
        He attended Trinity, Cambridge, 
        in 1810 to study mathematics, 
        graduated without honors from Peterhouse 
        in 1814 and received an MA in 1817. 
        In 1814 he married Georgiana Whitmore 
        with whom he had eight children, 
        only three of whom lived to adulthood. 
        The couple made their home in London 
        off Portland Place in 1815. 
        His wife, father, and two of his children died in 1827. 
        In 1828 Babbage moved to 1 Dorset Street, Marylebone, 
        which remained his home till his death in 1871. 
        He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society 
        in 1816 and occupied the Lucasian chair of mathematics 
        at Cambridge University from 1828 to 1839. 
        He died on October 18, 1871 and was buried 
        at Kensal Green cemetery in London.\n\n<b>Gentleman of Science</b>\nScience was not 
        an established profession, and Babbage, 
        like many of his contemporaries, 
        was a \'gentleman scientist\' &#8211; 
        an independently wealthy amateur well 
        able to support his interests from his own means. 
        The scope of Babbage\'s interests 
        was polymathically wide even by the generous 
        standards of the day. 
        Between 1813 and 1868 he published six 
        full-length works and nearly ninety papers. 
        He was a prolific inventor, mathematician, 
        scientist, reforming critic 
        of the scientific establishment and political economist. 
        He pioneered lighthouse signalling, 
        invented the ophthalmoscope, proposed \'black box\' 
        recorders for monitoring the conditions preceding 
        railway catastrophes, advocated decimal currency, 
        proposed the use of tidal power 
        once coal reserves were exhausted, 
        designed a cow-catcher for the front 
        end of railway locomotives, 
        failsafe quick release couplings 
        for railway carriages, 
        multi-colored theatre lighting, an altimeter, 
        a seismic detector, a tugboat for winching 
        vessels upstream, a \'hydrofoil\' 
        and an arcade game for members 
        of the public to challenge 
        in a game of tic-tac-toe. 
        His interests included lock picking, 
        ciphers, chess, submarine propulsion, 
        armaments, and diving bells. 
        Babbage was a prominent figure, 
        regarded as colorfully controversial 
        and even eccentric at home in England, 
        yet feted with honors by Continental academies. 
        He ached for recognition and was aggrieved 
        at its lack grumbling that the 
        Lucasian chair of mathematics at Cambridge, 
        was the only honor bestowed on him by his country.\n\n<b>Personal Life</b>\n
Babbage married Georgiana Whitmore in 1814, 
against his father\'s wishes. 
The marriage was a very happy one. 
Tragedy struck in 1827. 
In the space of a year his father 
with whom he had had a troubled relationship, 
his second son (Charles), 
Georgiana and a newborn son all died. 
Babbage was inconsolable. 
Close to breakdown he went on 
an extended trip on the Continent. 
There was a further cruel blow. 
His daughter, Georgiana, on whom he doted, 
died while still in her teens sometime around 1834. 
Babbage immersed himself in work. 
On his father\'s death he inherited 
an estate valued at \u00A3 &#163; 100,000, 
a sizeable fortune &#8211; somewhere between 
$6 and $30 million dollars in today\'s terms. 
He never remarried.\n\nIn the 1830s Babbage was 
a lion of the London social scene. 
His Saturday soirees were sparkling events 
in the London social calendar, 
and his house in Dorset Street 
was a hub of social and intellectual life. 
Celebrities, civil dignitaries, authors, 
actors, scientists, bishops, bankers, 
politicians, industrialists and socialites 
converged for gossip, intrigue, 
and the latest in science, literature, philosophy and art. 
\'All were eager to go to his glorious soirees\' 
wrote Harriet Martineau, writer and philosopher. 
Babbage was also a sought-after dinner 
guest with a reputation for being a captivating raconteur. 
\'Mr. Babbage is coming to dinner\' 
was a coup for any hostess.\n\n<b>The \'Irascible Genius\'</b>\nDiplomacy 
was not Babbage\'s forte 
and his social and professional personas were at war. 
Proud and principled, he was capable 
of incontinent savagery 
in his public attacks on the scientific establishment, 
often beyond ordinary sensibility. 
He offended many whose support 
he needed behaving sometimes 
as though being right entitled him to be rude. 
The title of the first biography 
on his life was called \'Irascible Genius: 
A Life of Charles Babbage, Inventor\'. 
The twin characteristics of irascibility 
and genius remain the defining signatures 
of his historical portrait.\n\n<b>Epilogue</b>\nIn a prophetic 
passage written towards the end 
of his life Babbage affirmed his conviction 
in the value of his work.\n\n<i>\'If unwarned by my example, 
any man shall undertake and shall succeed 
in really constructing an engine &#8230; upon different 
principles or by simpler mechanical means, 
I have no fear of leaving my reputation 
in his charge, for he alone will be fully 
able to appreciate the nature of my efforts 
and the value of their results.\'</i>\n\n<i>Source: Computer History Museum</i></string>
